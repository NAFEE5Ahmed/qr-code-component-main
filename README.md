## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I learned the advanced use of Flexbox
- I used flexbox in every container to ensure that I can manipulate and create any kind of design using flexbox

### Continued development

- I over used flexbox in this project
- I need to strong the understanding of grid in css for using flexbox and grid interchangeably to make a webpage interactive
